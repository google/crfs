Starting a container should be fast. Currently, however, starting a
container in many environments requires doing a `pull` operation from
a container registry to read the entire container image from the
registry and write the entire container image to the local machine's
disk. It's pretty silly (and wasteful) that a read operation becomes a
write operation. For small containers, this problem is rarely noticed.
For larger containers, though, the pull operation quickly becomes the
slowest part of launching a container, especially on a cold node.
Contrast this with launching a VM on major cloud providers: even with
a VM image that's hundreds of gigabytes, the VM boots in seconds.
That's because the hypervisors' block devices are reading from the
network on demand. The cloud providers all have great internal
networks. Why aren't we using those great internal networks to read
our container images on demand?
